# Chrome Extension Tool

This extension will help our investigation, test our development within the any web-site.

# Updates
 - 1.0.1 (19/02)
  Now you are able to edit, delete ou add new params on the url

## Motivation

Sometimes we need to do some research and for this we have to change some parameters in the url, and as often the url has many parameters the need for extra effort to achieve the necessary change.

We know that there are some similar extensions but we do not know how to use the data exposed. Another reason to use an internal app

# Tabs

-  Params

Params feature will help parsing the url params, separating it by key and value. Now we can 
change any param value and reload the page on the fly.
